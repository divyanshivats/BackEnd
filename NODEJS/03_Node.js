NPM, or Node Package Manager, is a tool that comes with Node.js and is used to install, manage, 
and share JavaScript packages or libraries. 
It's the default package manager for Node.js and is essential for handling dependencies in Node.js and frontend projects.

Functions:- 

-> to install javascript libraries

-> dependency management -  When you install packages, NPM automatically keeps track of them in a package.json file, 
    listing the libraries your project depends on. 
    You can then share this file with others, and they can use npm install to install all required packages.
